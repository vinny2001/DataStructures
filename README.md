# DataStructures

A compilation of my work from my data structures and algorithms class (CS 253). All code provided in Java.

Topics include:

Elementary sorting algorithm analysis (i.e. selectionSort, bubbleSort, insertionSort, etc)  (efficiency, time complexity data senstitivity, etc.)

Advanced sorting algorithm analysis (i.e. heapSort, mergeSort, quickSort, shellSort, etc.)  (efficiency, time complexity data senstitivity, etc.)

ADTs (1-d, 2-d, arrays, linked lists, heaps, trees, graphs, etc.) and the data structures used to implement them (i.e. stacks, queues, binary trees, 2-3 trees, sequences, etc.)


Discrete, empirical analysis of how data is structured and accessed - very theoretical!



Enjoy my (very, very hard) work!
